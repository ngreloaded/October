  /**
   * \brief
   * A class defines the properties of and object which contains the different features of objetcs which are of different datatype
   * The struct also does the same but the difference between them is class implements OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING Concepts of inheritance
   * Abstraction etc while this feature is not implemented by struct
   * By default the class members are private while the struct members are public

  /**
   * \brief
   * We use a type def to define a datatype as an alias to some other data type<br>
   * For Example : typedef roll int<br>
   * This defines a roll data type which is other name for int. It improves readability of the code

     * \brief This way of initialization is called 'member initialization list'. <br>
     * This way of initialization is in some sense better than the initialization by the parameter list of constructor.
     * There is a necessity associated with this kind of intialization when a class or a struct is member of some other class.
     * In these cases if the contained class has only one contructor that needs an argument to initialize the class , then the class
     * cannot be declared in the other class. But if the contructor uses the member initialization list then we can 
     * also use the contructor as default initializer also.
