  Box2d.jpg  box2dproj1.jpg  box2dproj2.jpg  box2dproj3.jpg  content.tex  main.bib  main.tex  title.tex
  
* Explanation of issues arising in part 4:
	After middle user, when I tried to push my changes, it flagged an error. I was asked to pull the changes made by middle
	user first. On doing that, git merged the two different makefiles, indicating the lines which were different. After that
	I manually edited the file to incorporate both the changes. After adding and commiting this time, I was able to push my
	changes now. 

* In log file of our remote repository, there are multiple commits by me for the last part as I was not able to remove all
  differences of makefile in one go.

* "make doc" creates both doxygen documentation and beamer report whereas "make report" creates only beamer report.

* We have used makefile that we submitted for lab 4 so that it is not needed to reinstall box2d.
